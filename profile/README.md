Hi👋, I'm a hobbyist game dev, currently focusing on [rust🦀 programming](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) and [bevy engine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) in my spare time. 

All public games I made are under MIT license, which means you can do whatever you want. Feel free to create issue or send pull request to me.

Anyone is very welcome to join the org to make new games with me if you have interest.

Please give a star⭐ to support my work if you like my games.

为了便于大家交流bevy游戏引擎，我建了微信群（加我微信 wx597422850 备注“bevy”进入）。欢迎加入，请勿闲聊。
